Please rate on the scale how well you believe you can perceive each specific signal. For example, if you often feel you need to urinate and then realise you do not need to when you go to the toilet you would rate your accuracy perceiving this bodily signal as low. Please only rate how well you can perceive these signals without using external cues, for example, if you can only perceive how fast your heart is beating when you measure it by taking your pulse this would not count as accurate internal perception.</p>",
